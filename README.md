# Supermarket_data
SQL Query where I analyze some data from supermarket sales

## Installation
Download the "Supermarket_Data" folder and put it on your desktop or wherever else feels best for you. I used Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio to run the SQL query, and so I'd reccomend you do the same. To load the data in correctly, you must open the Supermarket_Data_Query.sql file, and edit the filepath around line 28 to fit the filepath to the supermarket_sales.csv file. Now press run, and the program should run without issue.

## Usage
This is just a small SQL exercise where I answer some simple questions about the data. I got the dataset and questions from here:
